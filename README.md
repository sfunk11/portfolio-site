# About Me / Portfolio Site

## Description

This project involved building the front end of a personal portfolio site using Bootstrap 4 to style it. The styling is responsive to different viewport sizes. There are three pages: "About Me", "Portfolio",  and a "Contact" form. All three share a uniform style and you can navigate between the pages using the navigation menu.  Because this is front end only,  the contact form does not actually save or send information when submitted, but all of the other links are operational.
